# Xamarin.Form_Project

Project Scope:
You are tasked to design and create a user friendly new Xamarin Forms application which will allow a user, after signing in, to view the assets managed by an IoT 
platform. The application should compile, build and be able to run on both Android and IOS mobile platforms.

The user signed-in has the following assets in his account namely:
- 2 X Cars
- 3 X Trucks
- 1 X Generator
- 3 X Fridges.

Your project can use dummy / test data, but feel free to use a database / API if you wish. You need to use a good approach to guide a user in a user friendly 
way to have a high level view of the asset groups on the homepage but also be able to drill down to an individual assetâ€™s information to inspect / view its 
detail and any unhandled alerts.

Example of some alerts received by your application:
a) A vehicle is traveling at 140km/h and should not go faster than 120km/h
b) A truck is standing still on the same position for longer than it should. (Exceeding 2 hours)
c) A generator is running, indicating loadshedding kicked in / power dropped on the site
d) A fridge temperature is higher than 10 degrees celsius (normal operation < 10)

Your project should have at least the following screens:
1.) Sign-In page (You can hardcode the username and password)
2.) Homepage (Asset Groups)
3.) Asset Info Page (Viewing a selected asset)

Feel free to use any widgets and application flow you see fit. We will score you on ease of use by the user, application flow (simple and user friendly) and
design layout.
